## 3 — Design & Styling

### Brand and Visual Rules

* **Primary Palette:** Black `#000000`, deep charcoal `#231F20`.
* **Accent / Gold Variants:** `#FFD700`, `#AD974F`, `#8E793E`.
* **Neutral:** White `#FFFFFF`, Light Grey `#EAEAEA`.
* **Typography:** Elegant headline font (Playfair / Montserrat Bold) + readable body (Montserrat / Open Sans). Use `clamp()` for fluid sizing.
* **Spacing & Layout:** Grid-based layout, consistent gutters and spacing tokens.
* **Design Tokens:** Centralize color, spacing, font-sizes, radii, animation timings in a theme file (`tailwind.config.js` or design-tokens.ts).

### Visual Treatments

* Use subtle gold highlights for CTAs and key accents.
* Maintain strong contrast for text on dark backgrounds.
* Provide “text-safe” zones in hero images (keep top 30% of sky darker and bigger so headings remain legible).

## 4 — Interaction & Animation Design

### Principles

* Animate only transform/opacity where possible (GPU-friendly).
* Keep motion purposeful — avoid gratuitous animation.
* Provide `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
* Heavy or pinned scroll animations are disabled or simplified on mobile.

### Global Animated Background (site-wide)

Layered system:

1. Grid lines (thin 1px golden or white at low opacity) — subtle motion.
2. Aurora blobs (large radial gold gradients) — slow drift.
3. Cursor-reactive shine (radial glow following pointer) — interactive but subtle.
4. Vignette for focus.

Implementation notes:

* Use CSS layers & `will-change: transform, opacity`.
* Use `pointer`/`touch` position variables for interactive sheen.
* Scale down or reduce opacity on mobile.

### Hero

* Animated headline: typewriter/fade + emphasis on “Data-Driven”.
* Optional hero image overlay (Hero.png) that **fades out on scroll and fades back in on scroll up**. Use Framer Motion or a GSAP tween (`opacity` tied to `scrollY`).
* CTA buttons with micro-interactions (hover glow, ripple).

### Carousels

* **Desktop Circular Carousel**

  * 3D rotateY wheel, centered card scale emphasis.
  * Left/right arrows & keyboard navigation.
  * Touch/drag support but limited on mobile.
  * Rotation easing slowed to be pleasant (0.5s–1s tweens) with snap.
* **Mobile ScrollCarousel**

  * Vertical full-width cards, single card per viewport.
  * GSAP `ScrollTrigger` or native rAF entry animations.
  * Smooth swipe/scroll; no pinned sections.

### Cards & Micro-Interactions

* Cards: dim background by default, **hover/tap** increases background brightness (CSS `filter: brightness()` or overlay opacity), small lift (scale 1.02) and subtle 3D tilt on hover.
* Buttons: subtle glow/ripple on hover and tap.
* Footer reveal: invisible bricks become visible only during trigger; bricks rotate in a staggered ripple and reveal content.

---

## 5 — Accessibility & SEO (Required)

* Use semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`).
* Keyboard accessible navigation and dropdowns.
* Focus states and visible outlines, ARIA attributes for menus and carousels.
* `alt` text for images; meaningful link texts.
* Color contrast meets WCAG AA for primary interactions.
* Meta tags, structured data (Open Graph), sitemap.xml and robots.txt for SEO.

---

## 6 — Performance & Mobile Optimization (Non-functional Requirements)

### Performance Goals / Budgets

* **JavaScript main thread execution during load:** target ≤ 500ms (user requested).
* **60 FPS** on animations in normal conditions.
* **Lighthouse goals:** Performance & Accessibility ideally 90+ (desktop); 80+ mobile.
* Minimize layout thrashing and main-thread work.

### Concrete Measures

* Consolidate scroll listeners into a **ScrollManager** using rAF to batch updates.
* Use `ScrollTrigger.matchMedia()` to disable heavy animations on small screens.
* Lazy-load images (Next.js `next/image` / `loading="lazy"`).
* Serve WebP/AVIF for backgrounds and large images.
* Purge unused CSS (Tailwind purge).
* Code-split heavy modules (animation bundles) with dynamic imports.
* Avoid `backdrop-filter` and expensive CSS on mobile; remove or reduce on `<768px`.
* Use `will-change` sparingly and only on elements likely to animate.

## 7 — Architecture & Code Quality (How it should be built)

### Tech Stack Recommendation

* **Framework:** Next.js (React) — SSR/SSG for SEO, or plain React if simpler.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + scoped modules for special animations.
* **Animations:** GSAP (ScrollTrigger) + Framer Motion for declarative motion if desired.
* **State:** Local state + Context/Zustand for small global state (theme).
* **Images:** `next/image` or responsive `<picture/>`.
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions to run lint / tests / build.

### Coding Standards & Practices

* TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
* ESLint + Prettier enforced in CI.
* Small components (SRP), DRY, injection via props/config.
* Error boundaries for major UI areas.
* Unit tests for utility logic, integration/e2e tests for main flows (Cypress/Playwright).

## 8 — Interaction Flows (How things should work)

### Navigation UX

* Clicking main menu item navigates to the page.
* Clicking arrow toggles dropdown of sections (prevent propagation).
* Dropdown link scrolls to section (smooth scroll).
* Keyboard: `Tab`, `Enter`, `ArrowDown` supported.

### Hero Image Fade

* The hero background image opacity is driven by scroll position:

  * opacity = 1 at top
  * opacity reached 0 near 30% viewport scroll (configurable)
* On scroll-up, opacity restores smoothly.

### Client Carousel

* Desktop: rotating wheel; arrows rotate wheel; current card forward-facing; click flips card to back.
* Mobile: ScrollCarousel vertical list; reveal animations when card enters viewport.

### Footer Reveal

* Default: minimal dark footer with "Hover to follow us" (desktop) or "Tap to follow us" (mobile).
* On hover/tap: invisible bricks become visible and rotate away in staggered ripple; footer content appears.
* Hold/revealed state until mouse leaves (desktop) or tap outside (mobile).

## 9 — Testing, QA & Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Acceptance

* All pages render and content matches copy provided.
* Nav main click navigates to page; arrow opens dropdown; dropdown item scrolls to section.
* Hero animated text present; hero image fades on scroll as specified.
* Client carousels: Desktop and mobile implementations exist and are smooth.
* Magic brick footer reveals correctly on hover/tap.

### Performance Acceptance

* JS main-thread execution during load ≤ 500ms (target).
* LCP and FCP reasonable; images optimized; animations smooth (no jank) on modern mobile devices.
* All scroll-driven animations run at ~60 FPS under normal conditions.

### Accessibility & SEO Acceptance

* Keyboard nav works; focus states present.
* WCAG AA contrast for main content.
* Pages have meta tags, sitemap, and share previews.

### Cross-Device/Browser

* Test on major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) and major device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
* No overlapping elements on mobile; carousels adjust correctly.

## 10 — Build, Deployment & Maintenance

### Deployment Notes

* Host static site on Vercel / Netlify for easy CI/CD; point GoDaddy domain via DNS.
* Set up environment variables for production endpoints.
* Run production build and test in staging before DNS switch.

### Maintenance & Extensibility

* Keep design tokens centrally and update theme variables only in one place.
* Add new services/pages as feature folders.
