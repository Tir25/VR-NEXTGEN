                Most organizations have Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems — but while ERP is excellent for storing and managing data, it’s not an analytical tool. ERP consolidates data from departments — procurement, production, HR, and finance — in one place, but the real value emerges only when that data is analysed, visualized, and acted upon.
