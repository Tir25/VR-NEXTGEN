              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mb-4">Lean Management – Eliminating Waste, Enhancing Flow</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Lean focuses on removing non-value-added activities and improving flow efficiency across your value chain. We help organizations establish visual management systems and continuous improvement frameworks that maximize every resource.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Six Sigma applies data-driven statistical analysis to reduce process variation and defects. We deploy the DMAIC framework (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) to ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability across operations.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                SMED is a game-changer for operations with frequent setups. We convert internal setups to external setups to drastically reduce downtime.
